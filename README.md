# GrubDash
Project GrubDash
You've been hired as a backend developer for a new startup called GrubDash!
As another developer works on the design and frontend experience, you have been tasked with setting up an API and building out specific routes so that
the frontend developers can demo out some initial design ideas to the big bosses.

This project will test your ability to build APIs with complex validation.
To succeed at this project, you'll need to demonstrate that you can do the following:

Run tests from the command line.
Use common middleware packages.
Receive requests through routes.
Access relevant information through route parameters.
Build an API following RESTful design principles.
Write custom middleware functions.
You will not need to make any edits to HTML or CSS for this project.


To do so, you will be creating a server to access two resources, dishes and orders, in addition to error handling.
Your server should follow the structure that you've learned in the program. Complete the following tasks to pass the tests and this assessment.
